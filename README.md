# Computer Vision
In this repository there is a collection of assignments delivered for the **Computer Vision** class.  
The first one concerned the implementation and experimentation of different filterning techniques for noisy images.  
The second assignment's goal was double: to segment the image using normalized cross-correlation and to detect corners using Harris corner detection algorithm.  
The third project was an algorithm oriented to the estimation of the fundamental matrix correlating two stereo images.  
The last assignment covered motion analysis, in terms of optical flow and detection of changes between adjacent frames.
